# fragment: journeying

*2024-07-09*

Journeying isn't about *getting there*, though that's in the mix.

When the priest asks questions about a journey in progress, it's not just "(how) do I get there"?

But that doesn't mean things *just happen* along the way. The priest is in the flow of movement and unfolding.

The priest's choices along the way should help set the stage for what happens next. Things like...
- I'm taking precautions to avoid an anticipated scenario, namely \[x]
	- isn't it kind of a drag if a player takes precautions and thing never happens?
	- Maybe: I'm worried/suspicious about \[x]
- I'm looking for opportunities to do \[x].
- I'm curious about \[x].
- I think I might reach a waypoint, namely \[x].

I don't like repeatedly asking the volunteers if you arrive. Kind of an "are we there yet" scenario.

When you're on an actual journey, say a canoe trip, it might feel tedious. It depends on how you're spending your time, where your attention is as you go, what the conditions are like along the way. You're probably less pressed to arrive if you're making good time, in good company, with good weather.

So maybe the priest's questions could be about what they'd _like_.

- I'd like to know more about \[x].
- I'd like to find (a quicker way to / a way around) \[x].
- I'd like a chance to do \[x].
- I'd like it if \[x] were to happen.
- I pass the time by doing \[x].
- I'm keeping an eye out for \[x].
- I'm looking forward to \[x].

Ok. But what's the flow here? If the priest rolls high, do they just ask questions for each hit? Aren't those kind of a tax if all they want is to get there?

The last question is about narrative control, not agency. "I'm not really interested in thinking about this journey, can we cut to the end?" But if you're asking that about the journey, maybe that's a problem with framing. The journey needs to be interesting enough to be worth caring about *as well as* the destination. By the time you embark, you've spent a while establishing potentialities and eventualities. The journey is also about those.

So maybe hits offer chances to secure advantages along the way.

I also think one option might be, like, you spend all your remaining hits and say "I'm laser focused on getting there. Do I?" A bit of an "are we there yet" option but one that communicates social stakes.

Once the hits are all gone, the volunteers need to make a call: does the priest arrive, does the journey go wrong, or is there something *that needs to happen* along way?

Ideally, this call is informed by what the priest did on the road, and how well they rolled. So maybe something like...

> **When you've spent your last hit,** show your volunteers the list below and tell them to pick all that apply.
>
>- You arrive at your destination

Idk I'm getting stuck on this. Right now it feels like five hits is ultimately the same result as a miss but with more padding.
