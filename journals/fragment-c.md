# fragment: more journeying

*2024-07-13*

Ok, so you're only rolling to journey if there's some kind of risk. Presumably you've already taken measures to determine what it might be.

So maybe spending hits is a mixture of benefiting from the journey and preempting risk. Socially, it's about negotiating what the volunteers are going to hit you with. Like:

- I'm expecting \[x] to happen. Does it seem like it will?
- What tips me off that things might not be going according to plan?
- How can I avoid or get around \[x]?
- How can I make sure \[x] happens?
- Do I learn something new about my surroundings?

Also: rolling any hits at all should guarantee you make good progress. So then the roll establishes you're getting close, and maybe you make it. The hits are about what happens along the way.

Once you've spent your hits, the volunteers pick one:
- You arrive at your destination as planned.
- You arrive, but the journey is slow going or harder than expected. It costs you \[x].
- You'll make it there, as long as you deal with \[x].
- You make good progress, but things aren't what they seemed. Namely, \[x].

On a miss, an unexpected situation arises to jeopardize the whole journey. The priest still picks a chance, but they won't reach their destination as planned and must ask the volunteers why. These might include:
- They are waylaid.
- Their plan was critically flawed or incomplete.
- They meet with some freak accident.

Ok here's the real problem: volunteers don't need a reason to throw obstacles at the priest. If they have an obstacle they like, the should get a chance to use it.

What they do need is a framework for inserting obstacles and incidents.

Moreover, the *priest* should be allowed some assurance that the volunteers aren't just going to keep throwing shit at them forever.

Maybe when the priest embarks, the volunteers should get a minute to decide if there are any potential obstacles. They can use the Atlas and what they know about the journey to plot this out. The roll will determine how they get to use their incidents.

But then, say they have no incident in mind. Does that mean the journey just disappears?

Pros if it just disappears:
- Keeps focus on problem solving and tension.
- Makes things go quicker.

Cons it just disappears:
- Thematically unsatisfying. I want overland journeys to be textured and interesting. (But they are if there's incident!)
- I don't want the only kind of incident to be negative in character. Cool chance encounters should be welcome.

I find "cool chance encounters" a lot harder to imagine than problems. Here are some potential examples:

- Getting to know your charge better
- Learning something new.

Okay ACTUALLY, so if there's a list of nice things that happen on hits, you can pick a question, but you can also just turn the list over to the volunteers? Spending hits together should feel nice!
