# fragment: power and duty

2024-06-20

I'm thinking some more about my [journal from last night](2024-06-19.md) -- namely how part of my solution for distributing information asymmetrically was to give the volunteers a "new, additional duty" to enforce the Order's discipline.

There's an interesting push and pull between the notions of volunteering and duty! I want to keep the volunteers' job easy at the same time as I'm lashing them with new responsibilities.

I'm not the first to observe this, but it mirrors how occupying a position of power somewhat paradoxically binds you to those on whom your power depends. In asking the volunteers to embody a social hierarchy, I charge them with the maintenance of that hierarchy.
