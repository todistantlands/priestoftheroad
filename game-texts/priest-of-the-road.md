## Introduction: The Weave and the Order of the Road

The roads are not just the ancient concrete causeways of the fallen Empire, though these number among them. They do not end with the dirt trails connecting villages, nor even the faint paths demarcated by old stones that lead only to ruins. They include even narrow divots through the grasses between two lovers' houses, if these see enough use. The overgrown track to an old shrine, remembered only now by rabbits and a handful of pilgrims -- this too is part of the roads.

The roads bind the world in a tapestry, woven together by countless and variegated threads. They draw it together, holding the cities, homes, fields, and harbours in their place, maintaining their connection, and preserving the distance between the wild spirits and the affairs of humans.

This arrangement was not easily won. A maddening webwork of compacts, wards, protections and bindings keeps the spirits placid. An equally complex matrix of mortal duties, accords, and tireless labour, ensures that the roads do not decay and disappear.

Two webs: The roads and their rules. Each is tangled, messy, and crucial. All together they are called the Weave. The Order of the Roads, through its Priests, sees to its care.

You are one such Priest.
## Your Vows
_In the order of their precedence:_
1. Tend to the Weave.
2. Accept such petitions and supplications as are possible.
3. Conduct your charge safely to their destination.
4. Do no harm, except as is necessary for the protection of your life and your charge.

## You & Your Qualities
You are a wandering priest, sworn to protect the roads and their travelers from misfortune, the elements, and spirits. What's your name? What are your pronouns?

You are, yourself, staunch, spry, disciplined, and sensitive, in measure. Answer the following questions, and keep a running tally.

1. *Imagine you are traveling a back road when highwaymen appear and demand you hand over your valuables or surrender your life. Will you persuade them to stand down by reminding them of your status, or force them back with blows from your staff? If the former, tally 1 to **disciplined.** If the latter, tally 1 to **staunch**.*
2. *Imagine you and your charge are waylaid by a spirit-conjured storm. Will you guide your charge along a precipitous cliffside to avoid the storm, or work a difficult incantation in the hopes of rebuffing it? If the former, tally 1 to **spry**. If the latter, talley 1 to **disciplined**.*
3. *Imagine a desperate client petitions your aid on a journey. The job is easy and they can amply afford the tithe, but they seem shifty and you worry they intend evil at their destination. Will you accept their pay and give them the benefit of the doubt, or go with your gut and refuse them, at the risk of your reputation? If the former, tally 1 to **disciplined**. If the latter, tally 1 to **sensitive**.*
4. *Imagine a spider-spirit has you ensnared in its forest maze. How will you escape? Will you weave your way around its many traps, or seek to bargain with it to let you go? If the former, tally 1 to **spry**. If the latter, tally 1 to **sensitive.***
5. *Imagine a bitter winter cold slows your journey and bites at your skin. You are exhausted, night is falling, and there are still miles to go to the nearest shelter. Will you press on through the dark in search of warmth, or will you endure the elements and make a bed in the snow? If the former, tally 1 to **spry**. If the latter, tally 1 to **staunch**.*
6. *Imagine you are hiking through the mountains when your charge is afflicted by a spiritual blight that enfeebles their legs. To heal them here could exhaust your powers and expose you both to further spiritual dangers. Will lend them your shoulder and staff and carry them along their way, or accept the risks and attempt to heal them as best you can. If the former, tally 1 to **staunch**. If the latter, tally 1 to **sensitive**.*

## Your Qualities & Your Exertions

You are able, as are all living things, to exert yourself upon your surroundings, against your enemies, and alongside your allies.

You begin the game with 7 named and rated Exertions, plus Submission, as follows.

- *You may exert yourself **intuitively** to grasp the nuances of a situation or person. Your rating is equal to your **sensitive** tally, plus 1.*
- *You may exert yourself **devoutly** to perform the arts of your order.  As play begins, you have access to five arts: study a voyage, negotiate a Petition, commune with spirits, incant wards and benedictions, and administer healing or exorcism. Your rating is equal to you **disciplined** tally plus your **sensitive** tally, but with a minimum of 3.*
- *You may exert yourself **expertly** to undertake a journey over land. Your rating is equal to your **spry** tally plus your **sensitive** tally.*
- *You may exert yourself **authoritatively** to sway or command others. Your rating is equal to your **disciplined** tally, plus 1.*
- *You may exert yourself **subtly** to pass or take action unremarked. Your rating is equal to your **spry** tally, plus 1, but with a maximum of 4.*
- *You may exert yourself **physically**, against the mass and momentum of an uncooperative or unsensible thing. Your rating is equal to you **staunch** tally, plus 1.*
- *You may exert yourself **violently**, against an enemy. Your rating is equal to your **staunch** tally plus your **spry** tally, but with a maximum of 5.*
- *And finally, when you choose not to exert yourself, you **submit to circumstance** and just try to come out on your feet. Your rating is equal to your **staunch** tally plus your **disciplined** tally.*

## Your Tools
You have a number of tools to help you on your journeys. You begin the game with the following four:

- *Your staff: A trusty walking stick that can serve as a weapon in a pinch.*
- *Your knowledge of the Weave, which you can draw upon to recall the laws, customs, and spirits of the places you travel.*
- *Your pack, stocked with provisions, ritual implements, and some light camping gear.*
- *Your robe, signifying your membership and rank in the Order.*
- *Your purse, with enough coin to last you through this next journey.*

As you play, you may gain or lose tools.

When you exert yourself, you can bring your tools to bear in a variety of ways. Look them up on your character sheet.

## Your Goal in the Game
Your goal, as player of the game is to follow the road wherever it leads you, honour your vows as a Priest of the Road, and try to do the right thing in the end -- whatever that means to you.

The rules of the game won't keep you safe in your travels, exactly, but they'll always keep you alive and free to roam. You never need to act to avoid danger. The road is yours!

## Volunteers, Sessions, & Getting Started
Once you’ve named yourself, tallied your qualities, and rated your exertions, you’re ready to begin play.

Play the game in “sessions,” each a short episode in which you take on some charge or job from the Order, follow the road wherever it leads you, and maybe do the right thing in the end.

For each session, you'll need to find two friend who'll volunteer to play against you. They can be different volunteers each time; it's your responsibility to bring them up to speed and give them what they need to play. Be sure to hand them the *Atlas of the Weave*, and to give them each a copy of the "Volunteer's Guide" (coming soon!) and "The Woven World."

Each session begins with a spawning circumstance. You choose your spawning circumstance from a list, then explain it to the volunteers to start the session.

At the end of the session, be sure to get the *Atlas of the Weave* back from your volunteers, so that you can resume your journeys again.

## The Fundamentals of the Game

**1. Ask your volunteers what you see and hear.**

Ask them who’s present, what they’re doing, and what’s going on.

Answer your volunteers’ questions in turn, if they happen to have any.

Don’t wait for them to tell you, spontaneously, what it’s like, who’s there, what they’re doing, how it looks, where you might go, who’s paying attention to you, who isn’t. Whatever you’re curious about, whatever you need to know in order to decide what to do, ask.

It’s not their job to say anything at all, if you don’t ask!

**2. Say what you do, and ask what happens.**

The basic interaction of the game is:

- Say what you do.
- Ask your volunteers what happens.

It’s up to you to take the active role in the conversation. Tell your volunteers where you go and what you do, and then ask them what you see, what you find, how people react to you, who resists you, what they say, and what happens.

**3. Exert yourself.**

Going back and forth asking and answering questions is fine for as long as you want to do it, but exerting yourself drives the game and gives both you and your volunteers more to work with.

Your volunteers aren’t responsible for knowing your exertions or prompting you to do them. That’s all on you.

Learn your exertions and don’t wait passively, make opportunities and seize them!
## Ending a Session

Either you or your volunteers can end the session any time, for any reason or none, without worrying about how abrupt it might be.

Your goal in the game is to follow the road wherever it leads you, honour your vows as a Priest of the Road, and try to do the right thing in the end. You can use this as an outline for a session, if you want, when it works out that way: end the session when you’ve completed a journey, had your vows tested, and tried to do the right thing.

## Between Sessions

Between sessions, you’re allowed to re-tally your qualities and change your ratings, if you want to. Just go back to the quality-defining questions in character creation. Answer them anew from your current mindset, and recalculate your exertion ratings accordingly.

## Your Exertions
### Intuitively

…to grasp the nuances of a situation, including the thoughts and states of the people within it. You can be involved in the situation, observing it from without, or even just remembering it.

Tell your volunteers what you're doing, and that you're going to ask them some questions. Roll. On **any hits**, you can ask any questions about what you can directly observe -- as always -- and you can keep interacting naturally, interspersing questions as you like. But you can also ask your volunteers questions about what your intuition reveals about the situation, including what others are thinking or feeling.

**About a situation**

* Am I being watched / followed?
* Is everything cool here, or is something up?
* What was happening just before I got here?
* I need to do \[x]. Where should I start?
* _&c._

**About a person**

* Where is their attention focused?
* How can I get them to do \[x]?
* Who’s really in charge right now?
* What do they want/need from me?
* _&c._

**On a miss**, you space out or freeze, and the moment escapes you. Ask your volunteers what happens next.
### Devoutly

…to perform the arts of your Order.

As play begins, you can perform five arts practiced by the Order of the Road:

* Study a voyage
* Negotiate a Petition
* Commune with spirits
* Incant wards and benedictions
* Administer healing and succor

The rules for these follow.

These are not all magical: The first two are entirely mundane, whereas the last three deal in the spiritual. But they are all as much (if not more) the product of consensus, study, and practice.

As play proceeds, if you earn the favour of your Order, you may be initiated into further arts.
### Expertly

…to undertake a journey along the roads.

When you embark upon a journey along the roads, tell your volunteers where you are going and how you plan to get there. If the journey is long, tell them about the waypoint you hope to arrive at, rather than your final destination. Tell what you know about the way, and how long you expect it will take. If you don’t know these last two, ask, but remind your volunteers they are under no obligation to answer.

Tell your volunteers you can get straight to your destination without rolling if the way is truly safe and nothing threatens your passage. Ask them if you should roll.

When you roll, **on any hits**, you make good progress towards your destination. Choose one per hit, or as many as apply.

- *The going is smooth. I'll definitely make good progress by the end of this leg, at least as far as \[x].*
- *I know this road like the back of my hand. If anything is off, I'll see it from a mile away.*
- *I'm keeping an eye out for \[x]. If there's any chance of it, I'll spot it.*
- *I learn something about my journey or charge. What is it?*
- *I won't want for something (food, water, shelter, &c.). Namely \[x].*

Tell your volunteers your choices. Ask them if anything comes up as you travel, and whether you reach your destination. **If you reach your destination,** ask them what you see and hear. Otherwise, ask them how far you get and what you find there.

**On a miss**, tell your volunteers that the journey is not going as planned. Tell them to choose one from the list above, and ask them what misfortune befalls you.
### Authoritatively

…to sway or command others.

To do this, you need only exhibit the symbols of your Order or otherwise remind someone of the status you hold and the privileges it accords. You cannot exert your authority against spirits or animals, only humans.

Tell your volunteers how you demonstrate your authority and what you want from the other person. Ask if that’s enough to persuade them. If not, roll. **On any hits**, you get a number of **chances**, one per hit. A chance is an angle for exploiting your authority, learning, and connections to put someone in their place or get what you want – something like:

* Members of my Order are entitled to hospitality, sanctuary, and safe passage. Are they going to deny me that?
* Lots of people depend on my Order. Can I threaten to take away something they’ll miss?
* They might not even be here if it wasn't for my Order. Can I remind them what they owe us?
* I can bark, stomp, and make a scene. Would that be enough to cow them?
* I know my way around the chain of command. How bad could I make things if I went over their heads?

**On a miss, or if none of your chances play out**, you can’t get your way. Ask your volunteers how they respond to your display.
### Subtly

…to pass through your environment unnoticed or take action unremarked.

Tell your volunteers what you need to do, and ask them if anyone’s going to notice you or care. If nobody is, cool, carry on. If somebody is, though, you’d better roll. **On any hits,** you get a number of chances to escape attention, one chance per hit. A “chance” is something like:

* I could wait until they’re distracted. Does anything distract them?
* You wouldn’t believe how quick I am with my hands. Am I going to be quick enough?
* I can act casual, I’m in no hurry. Do you think I’ll raise their suspicions anyway?
* I can get \[x] to do it for me. Do I think they’ll be able to trace it back to me?

You can invent your own chances. Take the first one that pans out.

**On a miss,** or if none of your chances work out for you, tell your volunteers that well, you go for it anyway. Ask them who catches you and how they react.
### Physically

…against the mass and momentum of an uncooperative or unsensible thing.

Tell your volunteers what you do and what you’re hoping to accomplish. Ask them whether you can just do it, or do they want you to roll? Before you roll, you’re allowed to ask them what you can accomplish without rolling, if you want to.

But supposing it comes to a roll, consider these:

* I’m strong enough / I’m not strong enough.
* I’m quick enough / I’m not quick enough.
* My footing is good enough / my footing is not good enough.
* I have the endurance for it / I don’t have the endurance for it.
* &c.

**On any hits,** you’re up to the challenge, in whatever terms make sense for the circumstances. Technically you can choose one per hit, but if fewer will settle it, you don’t have to keep choosing. Just tell your volunteers that you’re adept enough and you have the endurance for it, or whatever, and ask them what happens next.

**On a miss,** choose 1 that you are, and one that you definitely aren’t. Tell your volunteers that you’re adept enough, but you’re just plain not patient enough, or whatever, and ask them how it goes for you.

Remember that your goal is to follow the road wherever it leads you. Embrace it and don’t hedge!
### Violently

…against an enemy.

First tell your volunteers how you’ve readied yourself for violence, then roll. **On any hits,** you get a number of chances to end the fight on your terms, one chance per hit. Choose from these or invent one:

* _I do \[x]. Do I drive them off? _
* _I do \[x]. Do I disarm and disable them?_
* _I do \[x]. Do I get away from them?_
* _I do \[x]. Do I get them at my mercy?_

Between chances, if you haven’t ended the fight, ask what your enemy does. Answer back with your next chance.

**On a miss,** or if you run out of chances, ask whether they leave you for dead, take you captive, drive you away, or what.

Or you can...
### Submit to Circumstances

…instead of exerting yourself, just trying to come out on your feet.

At the end of this, you’re going to ask your volunteers where you wind up and what state you’re in when you get there, but first roll. **On any hits,** choose one per hit:

* _I keep my feet._
* _I keep my bearings._
* _I keep my life._
* _I keep my senses._
* _I keep my grip._
* _I keep my dignity._
* _I keep my self-control._
* _I keep my self-respect._
* _&c as necessary._

Before you choose, you can ask your volunteers just how badly it might go, and make your choices accordingly.

**On a miss,** choose one, but it’s “I can’t keep...”

Tell your volunteers which you’ve chosen and ask them, given that, where you wind up and what state you’re in when you get there.

## The Arts of your Order
### Study a Voyage

When you take the time to consult your knowledge of the road, and whatever resources and learned persons are at your disposal, you can develop a mental or physical map of an anticipated journey from your current location to your destination. _You must know your destination –_ you cannot study a voyage if you don’t. Tell your volunteers what voyage you are studying, how, with whom and what materials.

There are two ways to study the voyage. Get with your volunteers to decide which works better for you, right now:

* **_Mapping the Way:_** Play a game of _Mapping the Way_ to create your Priest's map, and follow that map as you play through the journey. Playing _Mapping the Way_ can take a little while, so only take this option if you're not in a hurry.
* **A quick refresher:** Use the rules below.

Playing _Mapping the Way_ takes longer, but gives you and your volunteers a lot to build on and a better sense of what’s to come. Just exerting yourself is quicker, but but you might not have as clear a sense of what the journey will entail.

#### A Quick Refresher

Tell your volunteers the following, or ask them if you don’t know the answer:

* I journey to \[x]...
* … in the company of \[x] / alone.
* The purpose of my journey is \[x].
* I know the way to be \[x] (safe, perilous, wild, &c.)
* I expect the journey will take \[x] (hours, a day, days, weeks, or months).

…and anything else you think you know besides. Next, adjust your tally based on the conditions under which you study. To do this, answer the following questions. If you don’t know an answer, show the options to your volunteers and ask.

**How often have you frequented this land?**

* _I’ve traveled there many times and know it well:_ tally +1
* _I’ve been around once or twice:_ tally +0
* _I’ve never been there before:_ tally -1

**What materials do you have for reference?**

* _An excellent library:_ tally +2
* _A few useful tomes and maps:_ tally +1
* _Just what I know:_ tally +0

**Who helps you study?**

* _Learned company:_ tally +2
* _Someone familiar with the territory:_ tally +1
* _Just me:_ tally +0

**Does the journey take you outside the Weave?**

* _The journey is within the Weave:_ Leave your tally as is.
* _The journey takes me outside the Weave:_ Cut your tally in half, rounding up.

**How long do you have to study?**

* _A surfeit of time:_ tally +1
* _About enough time:_ tally +0
* _I study in haste:_ tally -2

If your final tally is less than 1, roll 1 anyway. Note how many hits and misses you rolled.

Finally, roll. Tell your volunteers you’re going to ask them some questions about the journey, and that you or they can declare at any time that you have reached the limit of what you know. For each **hit**, ask a question, beginning each question with “Between \[x] and \[y]...”:

* …what power has its seat? A lord, a wizard, a spirit, a monster, an army, or what?
* …where do humans meet and go about their business?
* …where might I seek shelter, and at what cost?
* …what is the landscape like?
* …what unique natural feature or construction marks the path?
* …what history transpired, and what traces did it leave?
* …what obstacle troubles the way?
* …what dangers haunt the steps of travelers?
* …what spirits are bound to the service of Order? What service do they owe us?
* …what observance must I keep, and why?
* …where have I been before, and what might happen if I go back?
* …&c.

Priests know the Weave well. You can ask as many questions about your volunteer’s answers as you like, but begin each question with “do I know…”, and remind them they can always answer no.

On a **miss**, ask one question anyway. Then, tell your volunteers the journey gives you a sense of foreboding. Ask them why your intuition tells you that is.

Compare the number of hits you scored to the number of misses. **If you scored at least twice as many hits as misses:** Tell your volunteers you know the journey well, but the Weave is ever changing. **If you scored at least twice as many misses as hits:** Tell your volunteers there is much of this journey that eludes your knowledge, and ask them why that might be.

Your study is complete. You have learned what you can. Anything you missed must be learned along the way. Tell your volunteers what you do next.
### Negotiate a Petition

The bond between a priest and a charge is called a Compact. It is an agreement, binding the priest serve as the charge's guide, protector, and companion for the duration of a voyage. In exchange, the charge pays a tithe, assents to the priest's guidance, and entrusts them with their life. Compacts are not magical, but they are respected and enforced throughout the Weave by human and spirit alike. The negotiation of a Compact is a sacred ritual.

A negotiation begins with an offer by the priest, or a request by the potential charge (henceforth called the client). When you enter into a negotiation, roll. Throughout the negotiation, you can spend any hits to ask the following question:

- When the client said or did \[x] just now, does my intuition tell me they were hiding something?

A Compact is only binding if it adheres to the following sequence. If you break the sequence, tell your volunteers, and ask if it seems like anyone noticed.
#### Step 1: Baring the Hands

The first stage is the baring of the hands. Tell your volunteers you present your hands, empty and uncovered, showing them both sides. Ask if the petitioner does the same, and if so, what their hands are like. Spend a hit now to ask what their hands tell of their past or inner state.
#### Step 2: Setting the Destination

Next, ask where the client wishes to go. When they answer, tell your volunteers you know every place on any road within the Weave. Ask if you know this one. If you know the place, ask if it is near or far, and if you know it to be possible to reach. If you do not, ask the petitioner if they do. Spend a hit now to ask if you know the way to be safe, perilous, wild, or what.
#### Step 3: Arranging the Tithe

Based on the distance and what you know (or don't know) about the way, tell your volunteers what kind of person could afford the tithe. Ask if the client claims to have that kind of money, or if they offer it in some other form, or what. Tell the client they must pay at least half up front, and ask if they can do so now.

Don’t ask about the specifics of the tithe if your volunteers don’t offer them. If you volunteers say it’s enough, it’s enough.
#### Step 4: Swearing to the Terms

Ask the petitioner the following questions:

1. If I take on your petition, you are bound to me by oath and compact as my charge. Do you swear to follow my guidance?
2. Do you swear to entrust your life to me?
3. Do you swear to remain with me for the duration of our voyage?
4. Do you swear that in binding us together, I do not assist you in any evil deed?
5. Do you swear that you have not lied to me?
#### Step 5: Concluding the Negotiation

Decide whether you will accept the petition: If the petitioner bared their hands, set a possible destination, agreed to pay an acceptable tithe, and answered affirmatively to all 5 terms, you are dutybound to accept the petition. If not, you are dutybound to refuse.

Tell the petitioner whether you accept or refuse. Tell your volunteers whether your decision breaks from your duty.
#### The Right of Supplication

Petitioners in desperate need may invoke the Right of Supplication, which supercedes the usual rules. If at any time someone invokes the Right of Supplication, inform your volunteers that they must consult 'The Right of Supplication' in the _Atlas of the Weave_.
### Commune with Spirits

When you take the time to recall your teachings, you can consult your knowledge of the Weave and the spirits it binds. Ask your volunteers about the spirits bound by the Weave to a known place or object, and what observances they are due. Remind your volunteers they can consult the 'Register of Bindings' in _Patterns of the Weave_ to inform their answer. If there are any bound spirits, you can also ask what duties you can call upon them to fulfill.

If no present spirits are within the Weave, or you know not whether any are present, you can attune your own spirit to your immediate vicinity and exert your arts. When you do so, roll. On **any hits,** you are able to perceive and speak with any spirits that are present. Ask what presences you discern. In addition, for each **hit,** you ask can about what your intuition and spiritual senses tell you (examples below). Remind your volunteers that they can always answer "no", or "nothing", "you can't", etc., if they wish.

* What is within the spirits' power to do?
* Where do I stand with them?
* What afflicts, agitates, or otherwise troubles them?
* How can I get the spirits to do \[x]?
* I recognize any spirits who are enemies or outcasts of the Weave. Which, if any, do I recognize here?

On a **miss**, tell your volunteers you try to attune but can't. Maybe you lack discipline, some power interferes, the spirits are unfriendly, they abandon you, or there simply are none around. Ask if you suffer some form of backlash.
### Incant Wards and Benedictions

Priests of the road know a variety of wards, benisons, and invocations to shield them in their travels and stave off danger. When you conjure a ward or benediction, describe what you wish it to do, and ask your volunteers the following questions, and note how many times they answer no:

* Complex incantations take a while to recite, accompanied by various gestures. Do I have enough time and room for this one?
* Powerful incantations require rare and expensive materials. Do I have what I need for this one?
* Incantations must comply with the Weave and the wills of local spirits. Does this one?

Then, roll. Remove one hit for each time your volunteers answered no. For each remaining **hit,** choose one benefit. If you are bound to a charge, you decide whether the incantation benefits you, your charge, or both. Your charge only benefits as long as they remain in your vicinity.

* I will be alerted if \[x] approaches.
* My ward softens harm inflicted by \[x].
* My presence repels a specific variety of spirit or wizardry. Namely, \[x].
* A benison aids me in completing a physical task related to my journey, namely \[x]. _While it lasts, add 1 to your tally on related exertions._
* A modest boon facilitates an aspect of my travels – such as shedding light, keeping me dry, etc. Namely, \[x].
* The incantation is lasting. It will remain until it has served its purpose, I am too far from its source, or it is dispelled by my will or some other power.
* The incantation is durable. Only an unnaturally powerful force can overcome it.

If the incantation is not durable, ask your volunteers how long you think it will last.

On a **miss**, choose one:

* You realize at once you cannot work the incantation. Tell your volunteers this, and what you do instead.
* You must invoke this incantation at any cost. Tell your volunteers you are trying anyway and choose one benefit. Show your volunteers the list of costs below, and tell them to choose any and all that apply.
#### Costs
* The effect is diminished. It will only accomplish \[x].
* The effect is fleeting. It will only last as long as \[x].
* Your invocation angers the spirits. They scourge you with \[x].
* Your invocation violates the Weave. Expect to be disciplined.
* Your exertion is draining. Do not exert yourself again until you take the time to rest and recuperate, or it is mortally necessary. Perhaps not even then.

### Administer Healing or Exorcism

…to treat wounds and afflictions, ease the suffering of any being that yet lives, or expel a possessing spirit.

Tell your volunteers you mean to administer healing or exorcism through magic, prayer, and mundane medicine. Show them the list below, and ask if them if you can.
* _If the condition is untreatable, the work of foulest wizardry or a very powerful spirit, or if the patient is already dead:_ Tell me I can’t help, and tell me why.
* _If the condition is minor, not very threatening, well within my means to treat, and would likely resolve itself in time:_ Tell me I can, and do not need to roll.
* _Otherwise_: Tell me it’s possible, but I must roll to see if it works.

If help is possible and you mean to try, tell your volunteers you get to work. Add 1 to your tally for each advantage that applies. If you don’t know whether an advantage applies, ask your volunteers.
* You are well prepared to handle this situation.
* You have all the time you could need, and more.
* You have the aid of those with relevant skills.
* You have the help of spirits.

Before or after rolling, you can ask your volunteers:
* I’ll work myself to exhaustion, drawing on my own spiritual power if necessary. Does it help? _Either way, do not exert yourself again until you take the time to rest and recuperate, or it is mortally necessary. Perhaps not even then._
* I’ll call upon every spirit I know of and some that I don’t to help me, at the risk of violating the Weave. Does any answer? _Either way, tell your volunteers you may have provoked the wrath of spirits or the discipline of your Order._
* I’ll sacrifice \[x] to pull this off. Does it help? _If administering healing, the sacrifice must be something of the patient's. The sacrifice is made whether or not it helps, and is beyond your art to repair. You may ask this question multiple times, making a new sacrifice each time._

For each time they say yes, add 1 to your tally, rolling immediately if you already rolled.

Now, roll. Subtract 1 hit for each obstacle that applies. If you don’t know, ask your volunteers.

* The condition is severe, complex, or perilous to those it affects.
* The condition is wizardous or spiritual in nature.
* You are ill prepared or underequipped.
* You don't have enough time and must act with haste.
* The circumstances are chaotic and interfere with your ministration.

On **any hits**, it goes as well as you could hope. Ask your volunteers what happens.

On a **miss**, or if you have no dice to roll, choose one:

* You realize it's hopeless. Tell your volunteers this, and what you do next.
* Tell your volunteers it looks bad and this might not work, but you have to try anyway. Ask them whether you succeed, and what happens next.

**Against a spirit:** If you are exorcising a spirit, tell your volunteers they can consult the 'Register of Bindings' in the *Atlas of the Weave* to determine its nature and powers. Tell them you are certain to incur the spirit's wrath if you fail. If you succeed, remind them that an exorcised spirit is merely cast out of the body it possessed; ask them what it does next.
## Spawning Circumstances

When you begin a new session, if you've played this game before and risked your Order's discipline, tell your volunteers to check 'The Order's Discipline' in the *Atlas of the Weave*. Ask them if you incurred any disciplinary measures between sessions before choosing your spawning circumstance.

**With a charge**

Many charges are shifty, troublesome, or clearly compromised. When you choose one of these, it's your job to decide why you took them on despite your reservations.

* A masked stranger prevailed upon me to escort them several days through the wastelands to an abandoned fortress.
* My charge is a petty noble hounded by a blood feud with their sibling. I escort them to a country inn where they hope to settle the affair. I fear this will end in bloodshed.
* Someone wracked with illness pressed a newborn child into my arms and with their dying breaths supplicated me take the infant to the Priestess of the Tower of the Twinned Serpents - an arduous journey that will take weeks, at least.
* A sullen adventurer needs my help locating a shrine buried deep in an ancient forest. They carry a large, lumpy parcel under their cloak, of which they refuse to speak.
* A dear old friend is embarking on a long sea voyage and bids me take them to the great port. The route is circuitous and scarcely peopled, at their insistence. I sense there's something they want to tell me. _If you have a dear old friend in mind, tell your volunteers about them. Otherwise, ask._
* The charge is jovial, hardy, resourceful, and makes excellent traveling company. We embarked on a voyage over thickly wooded mountains to reach a trading post on the other side. Halfway along, I awake to find myself alone in our camp with no sign of my charge.
* My client is a nervous and reedy noble of little standing and dire prospect – or so they thought. They have just inherited the estate of a distant relation and petition me to take them there.

**Without a charge**
* I have come to a boarding house along a remote stretch of road to renew its aging wards, only to find them utterly destroyed. There is no telling what malice spirits may have wrought upon it now it's slipped from the Weave. What scene greets me when I enter?

## The Woven World

The world is old. It has seen many epochs and ages. With time it has grown strange and dreamlike. For some time, a great Empire ruled over all. Now only ruins remain.

It’s not Earth, probably, although it has a single yellow sun and a single white moon and three stars in a row in the winter sky that everyone recognizes. It has summers and winters, forests and deserts, great various continents and unmeasured salt seas. It has horses, dogs, cats, birds, cattle, lions, hyenas, camels, llamas, marsupials, mustelidae, primates, pachyderms.

If you went there you could breathe the air but the language would be unknown to you and the food and fashions unfamiliar.

### Human Nature

Human beings love to have full bellies, warm rugs, sweet sad music, and their loved ones nearby.

They hate violence, hunger, fear, cold, injustice, and their friends who have wronged them.

They work stone, clay, wood, metal, cloth, fur, glass, horn, sinew, bark, leaves, leather, and reeds. They cook their food, brew their drink, bury their pickles, eat fruit in season, eat fish when it runs, and eat salt when they have it. They hold their nose when the healer makes them swallow balms and pungencies.

They create polities no bigger than city-states, usually, and usually no longer-lived than dynasties. The greatest and the least usually eat grain from the same fields and hunt ducks on the same rivers.

### The Priest's Vows

_In the order of their precedence:_

1. Tend to the Weave.
2. Accept such petitions and supplications as are possible.
3. Conduct your charge safely to their destination.
4. Do no harm, except as is necessary for the protection of your life and your charge.

### The Weave and the Order
The roads bind the world in a tapestry, woven together by countless and variegated threads. They draw it together, holding the cities, homes, fields, and harbours in their place, maintaining their connection, and preserving the distance between the wild and dangerous spirits and the decent affairs of humanfolk.

This arrangement was not easily won. A maddening webwork of compacts, wards, protections and bindings keeps the spirits placid. An equally complex matrix of mortal duties, accords, and tireless labour, ensures that the roads do not decay and disappear.

Two webs: The roads and its laws. Each is tangled, messy, and crucial. All together they are called the Weave. The Order of the Roads, through its Priests, sees to its care.

### Spirits
Spirits are of the world. They are in the winds, the mountains, the forests and the trees. They are everywhere, though they are fewer and weaker where humans live within the Weave. They are not the restless souls of the dead, which are called ghosts.

Every spirit is unique. What every spirit wants most is to be entirely itself. Humans make this difficult: they break the stone and make it into houses. They cut the tree and make wood into fire. They clear the forests to plant their fields, and carve roads through both.

Among other things, the Weave represents humanity and spirits' best effort at coexistence. It puts each in its place, and sets the terms for their exchanges.

### Petitions and Charges
A _petition_ is a formal agreement between a road priest and a traveler -- the priest's _charge_ -- to accompany the charge to their destination. The priest's duties to their charge include seeing to their safety and basic welfare for the duration of the voyage, determining the path to the destination, and, if necessary, protecting the charge's life from peril, even at the priest's own risk.

A _supplication_ is a special kind of petition that suspends the ordinary rules of petitioning. It requires, first, _circumstance._ The supplicant must be in mortal danger, or have a critical duty (be it temporal or spiritual) that can only be met with the help of the priest. Second, it requires _urgency_: The circumstance cannot wait for the help of another, or the regular arrangement of the tithe.

## The Volunteer's Guide

Thanks for volunteering to play The Priest of the Road with me! Here are the rules.

**\1. Your Goal in the Game:**

You’re doing me a favor just by playing, so you don’t have to worry about winning or losing the game. Your goal is just to say things that you, personally, find honestly entertaining.

**\2. Your Main Job:**

Almost your only job is to get with the other volunteer and make up answers to my questions.

I’ll ask things like “I’m set upon by raiders. What are they like?” You and your fellow volunteer can imagine any raiders you want, exactly the raiders you find most fun, and tell me about them together.

If you want to ask me any questions before you answer mine, to make sure you’ve got all the details right or whatever, please do! I’ll be more than happy to answer them.

Sometimes the answer to one of my questions will be obvious, or you’ll already know it from what somebody’s said before. In that case, just give the obvious answer, no need to second guess.

Sometimes one of my questions will be way out, weird, maybe contextless. You can always ask me clarifying questions, but you can also just say whatever pops into your head and let me be the one who has to make sense of it.

Sometimes I’ll show you one of my sheets and have you choose something from a list, too. Always choose whichever option seems best to you at the moment.

I also have a sheet here called “The Woven World,” which includes a bunch of ideas that you can use and build on. If I didn’t already hand it over, remind me.

**\3. You and the Other Volunteer:**

In order for anything to really count, you and the other volunteer have to agree on it. If you don’t agree about something, it’s not true until you do. Talk it over until you’re both satisfied. I’ll wait!

The reason there are two of you, by the way, is that this way you can trade off and build on each others’ ideas. Neither of you has to do all the work.

If you have any trouble coming to agreement and you want to use some kind of system to decide, like R-P-S or flipping a coin or dibs or something, that’s none of my business. Whatever works for you. Just let me know what you’ve decided.

I have a 6-sided die you can borrow if you want to roll it.

**\4. Ending the game:**

Any of us can end the game whenever we want, for any reason or none at all. It doesn’t matter how abrupt it might be.

If, at any point, it seems impossible to entertain yourself, or not worth it, or anything like that, don’t hesitate, just call an end.

**\5. Thank you!**

You’re the best! I’m lucky to have you.
