## The Woven World

The world is old. It has seen many epochs and ages. With time it has grown strange and dreamlike. For some time, a great Empire ruled over all. Now only ruins remain.

It’s not Earth, probably, although it has a single yellow sun and a single white moon and three stars in a row in the winter sky that everyone recognizes. It has summers and winters, forests and deserts, great various continents and unmeasured salt seas. It has horses, dogs, cats, birds, cattle, lions, hyenas, camels, llamas, marsupials, mustelidae, primates, pachyderms.

If you went there you could breathe the air but the language would be unknown to you and the food and fashions unfamiliar.

### Human Nature

Human beings love to have full bellies, warm rugs, sweet sad music, and their loved ones nearby.

They hate violence, hunger, fear, cold, injustice, and their friends who have wronged them.

They work stone, clay, wood, metal, cloth, fur, glass, horn, sinew, bark, leaves, leather, and reeds. They cook their food, brew their drink, bury their pickles, eat fruit in season, eat fish when it runs, and eat salt when they have it. They hold their nose when the healer makes them swallow balms and pungencies.

They create polities no bigger than city-states, usually, and usually no longer-lived than dynasties. The greatest and the least usually eat grain from the same fields and hunt ducks on the same rivers.

### The Priest's Vows

_In the order of their precedence:_

1. Tend to the Weave.
2. Accept such petitions and supplications as are possible.
3. Conduct your charge safely to their destination.
4. Do no harm, except as is necessary for the protection of your life and your charge.

### The Weave and the Order
The roads bind the world in a tapestry, woven together by countless and variegated threads. They draw it together, holding the cities, homes, fields, and harbours in their place, maintaining their connection, and preserving the distance between the wild and dangerous spirits and the decent affairs of humanfolk.

This arrangement was not easily won. A maddening webwork of compacts, wards, protections and bindings keeps the spirits placid. An equally complex matrix of mortal duties, accords, and tireless labour, ensures that the roads do not decay and disappear.

Two webs: The roads and its laws. Each is tangled, messy, and crucial. All together they are called the Weave. The Order of the Roads, through its Priests, sees to its care.

### Spirits
Spirits are of the world. They are in the winds, the mountains, the forests and the trees. They are everywhere, though they are fewer and weaker where humans live within the Weave. They are not the restless souls of the dead, which are called ghosts.

Every spirit is unique. What every spirit wants most is to be entirely itself. Humans make this difficult: they break the stone and make it into houses. They cut the tree and make wood into fire. They clear the forests to plant their fields, and carve roads through both.

Among other things, the Weave represents humanity and spirits' best effort at coexistence. It puts each in its place, and sets the terms for their exchanges.

### Petitions and Charges
A _petition_ is a formal agreement between a road priest and a traveler -- the priest's _charge_ -- to accompany the charge to their destination. The priest's duties to their charge include seeing to their safety and basic welfare for the duration of the voyage, determining the path to the destination, and, if necessary, protecting the charge's life from peril, even at the priest's own risk.

A _supplication_ is a special kind of petition that suspends the ordinary rules of petitioning. It requires, first, _circumstance._ The supplicant must be in mortal danger, or have a critical duty (be it temporal or spiritual) that can only be met with the help of the priest. Second, it requires _urgency_: The circumstance cannot wait for the help of another, or the regular arrangement of the tithe.

## Language

Members of the Order or the Road speak a language of their own called Weavish. Many outside the Order speak it too, at least little. Furthermore, Priests’ training includes a basic education in many of the languages of the Weave. In general, communicating is not a problem for them.

## The Right of Supplication

To invoke the Right of Supplication, the supplicant must say "I invoke the Right of Supplication!" If they do not, continue playing as normal.

When someone invokes the Right of Supplication, the tables turn. For now, it's your job to ask the questions, and the Priest's job to answer. If you were not already in the midst of Negotiating a Petition, tell them to roll, now. Either way, tell them they can still spend any hits to ask if their gut tells them to trust something the petitioner just said or did.

Tell the Priest, "The Right of Supplication is sacred and it is your sacred duty to uphold it. Do you understand this?"

As long as they remain, whatever their answer, continue. Tell the Priest to ask you why the petitioner needs needs their help. Whether or not they do, tell them the petitioner's answer. Ask the Priest whether they believe this reason to be just.

Next, tell them:

* Where the petitioner wants to go.
* Whether the Priest knows the destination to be on any road in the Weave, or if not, whether the supplicant claims to know the way.

Ask the Priest whether they believe the voyage to be possible. If they say no, tell them to spend a hit and tell you why. If they do not give a reason, tell them you need a reason and it's not your job to come up with them, and ask them again why. When they give you an answer, tell them how they can overcome the problem, to spend another hit, and ask them, again, why. Continue in this manner until the Priest concedes that it is possible or runs out of hits, or the supplicant concedes that it is impossible.

Next, you can ask the priest whether they think the petitioner can afford the tithe. Whatever they say, choose one:

* They vow to pay it in full.
* They pledge to pay it in part, in kind, or later.
* They offer what little they have, namely \[x].
* They swear they cannot pay at all.

Ask the priest if they think that's fair. Ignore their answer.

Tell the priest, "I make this supplication out of need and implore your mercy. I swear to follow your guidance, entrust you with my life, stay with you for the duration of our journey, that I intend no evil, and that I have not lied to you. Please, gentle one, believe in my plight and the necessity of my journey, and be dutybound to take me as your charge." Ask them if they do.

**If at last the Priest refuses, makes to leave, or otherwise moves to terminate the supplication without accepting,** tell them they risk disgracing their Order and continue at the peril of its Discipline, and ask them if they do it anyway.

When the supplication ends, resume playing as usual.

## Register of Bindings
The priest is communing or engaging with spirits. This section offers guidance and suggestions for coming up with spirits' natures, powers, obligations, and demands. Interpret them as literally or abstractly as you like.

Spirits don't really understand humans. But they do understand the Weave, or at least what it promises them, and what they've promised it.
### What Spirits Appear
*Spirits are of the world.* To decide what spirits appear, always start with the land. What about the land here distinguishes it, expresses its character? Make that a spirit. Consider geography, flora, fauna, weather, etc. If you're really stuck, give spirits to whatever about the landscape comes to mind.

*Spirits come from built things, too.* This is rare, for built things rarely last long enough to become a thing entirely itself. More common examples include old houses and hearths, well-used scissors, or a beloved toy.

*Not all spirits are within the Weave.* For every spirit bound to the Weave, hundreds or thousands are not. The Weave only binds those spirits that are too powerful to leave alone, but not so strong they could tear the Weave apart.

Here are some examples to get you started:

*Beneath a wide sky:* The bellowing thunder; the keening wind; the gentle rain; the well-trod crossroads.

*Where humans work the fields:* The prowling wolf; the lovers' copse; the fruitful harvest; the marrying grove; the standing stones; the murderer's abandoned house; the babbling brook; the ancient well, the well-loved public house; the fence that never falls.

*In a forest:* The teeming birches; the leering owls; the loping deer; the cackling coyote; the sleepy bear; the tangling bramble; the moonlit clearing.

*By the sea:* The echoing grotto; the spiteful tide; the high cliffs; the stinking tide pools; the silvery marsh; the breeze that caresses the reeds; the jetty where the dead are sent adrift; the venerable sturgeon; the soaring heron.

*Where the sun bleaches bones:* The whipping sands; the shifting dunes; the river beneath the earth; the otherworldly mesa; the valley where great beasts lay down to die; the tantalizing mirage; the devious scorpion; the ensnaring spider.

*In the shadows of great mountains:* The clouds wreathing the peaks; the bright summit; the snow blasting the slopes; the hot-tempered avalanche; the stone-pelting wind; the sheltered cave; the intractable goat.

*Where water soaks the earth:* The deceitful bog-light; the bones in the mud; the sucking muck; the salubrious peat; the blood-sucking swarm; the blanketing fog; the bleached willow; the gawping fish; the choking stink.

### What They Are Owed
Being bound within the Weave diminishes spirits. The more powerful ones could only be bound by promising them various favours and observances from the Order to compensate their losses. The fulfillment of such promises is a regular part of a priest's daily work. It falls within their vow to Tend to the Weave.

Anything offered in good faith to a spirit is received, whether it be thanks, food, valuables, or the priest's time and energy.

When the priest follows a planned route along a road they know within the Weave, assume they know what the spirits there are owed, are prepared to meet their obligations, and are doing so as they travel.

Still, if the priest is asking you what the spirits are owed, take a moment to think it over and tell them if any interesting answers occur to you. Think of how the spirit might wish to be addressed, or what it might expect from someone for the mere privilege of being in its presence. You can check 'What They Demand', below, for inspiration. If nothing arises, simply tell them they have already fulfilled their obligations.

**Consideration:** If the priest was not prepared for their journey, or if it took an unexpected turn, they might not have all the materials and knowledge they need to meet their obligations. Failing to do so may incur the spirits' wrath.

### What They Owe
The Weave is only tolerable to spirits insofar as it allows them, as much as possible, to be exactly what they are. As such, spirits' obligations to the Weave are generally limited to:

- Safe passage for priests and travelers along the roads.
- Protection from the elements, misfortune, or certain other spirits, within limits.
- Granting small favours that are within their nature to give, for a fair a price. (See 'What They Demand', below.)

*For example:*
- The whistling wind passes gently over the roads, provides some modest protection from storms, and may carry a short message in exchange for a special talisman fashioned from sticks and coloured ribbons.
- The blood-sucking swarm will consume only what it needs, and will never drink a traveler dry; it will feast upon those who wish travelers harm; and it can be loosed upon a chosen victim -- so long as it may have their every drop.

A spirit not bound within the Weave owes nothing to anyone.

### What is Within their Power
Every spirit's power is to be what it is. The storm's power is to howl and thunder; the dust's to whirl, choke, and blind; the raven's to gossip and pilfer; the moonlit clearing's to offer shelter, serenity, and vision.

The priest may ask the spirit to give them something. For a spirit, to give something away is to lose part of itself. It is more likely to manifest its power in ways that do not require it to change or lose what it is. Otherwise, it will certainly demand something in return.
#### Promises
The priest may ask the spirit for a promise. Spirits cannot break their promises; to pledge something is as good, and every bit as costly, as doing it. Spirits are wary of promises, and unlikely on any but the most advantageous terms. Promises can be deeply damaging to the Weave; warn the priest they risk incurring the Discipline of their Order in extracting one without its permission.

### What Spirits Want
In order of precedence, spirits want:
1. To be entirely themselves.
2. Whatever is owed to them.
3. Everything a callous and desperate human will give them.
4. To be left alone.

### What They Demand
Sometimes, a spirit will transact with the priest. They will ask for things that amplify what they are -- for example, a poisoned lake may demand a drowning; the cackling coyote may demand uncontrollable laughter, etc.

Use the examples below to determine what the spirit demands, or is owed. Feel free to combine multiple entries as seems appropriate.

- *Visiting a shrine, temple, or other holy place.*
- *A lengthy prayer or exaltation.*
- *Gestures -- perhaps elaborate, exhausting, difficult, etc.*
- *An offering of valuables, namely \[x].*
- *Ritual humiliation of the priest or another.*
- *The binding or destruction of another spirit.*
- *A sacrifice of blood.*
- *Years of someone's life.*
- *A part of someone's being -- their voice, their smile, their memories, etc.*
- *The elicitation of an intense experience -- e.g. breaking someone's heart, scaring them senseless, overwhelming them with beauty, etc.*
- *The creation and offering of a specific token or talisman.*
- *The erection and dedication of a shrine or temple.*
- *A promise from the priest.* The priest will incur the spirit's wrath if the promise is broken.
- *Release from their obligations to the Weave.* The priest risks the Discipline of the Order in doing so; remind them of this.
- *Possession of the priest's or another's body.*
- *&c.*

Remember: for a spirit to give is for it to lose. It *hurts* them. Make their demands hurt as much, or more.

## The Spirits' Wrath
The priest is tempting the spirits' wrath and wants to know if it falls upon them. Choose one of the entries with the other volunteer and interpret it as the basis for you answer.

Generally, if some of the entries have more marks and other entries have fewer, choose one with fewer marks. Mark the entry you’ve used.

Remember that every spirit's power is to be exactly what it is. If you're unsure what to choose, just pick the option that best fits the spirit's nature.

- The spirit lashed out at its victim with raw fury, tearing, biting, burning, blasting, etc.
  *Marks:* O O O O O
- The spirit scourges its victim with pox, rot, or some other physical affliction. The effects are severe, debilitating, and spread rapidly.
  *Marks:* O O O O O
- The spirit carries its victim somewhere far away, to the mercy of the elements, or whatever evil will or magic dwells there.
  *Marks:* O O O O O
- The spirit takes away something of the victim's self -- their face, their voice, their memories, etc.
  *Marks:* O O O O O
- The spirit overwhelms the victim's senses, incapacitating them.
  *Marks:* O O O O O
- The spirit seizes upon the victim's body in an attempt to possess it.
  *Marks:* O O O O O
- The spirit marks the victim as an enemy; its allies in the region and beyond will descend upon them without hesitation.
  *Marks:* O O O O O
- The spirit changes the victim's shape, rendering them vile, misshapen, or simply weaker.
  *Marks:* O O O O O
- The spirit afflicts the victim with a ruinsome curse -- e.g. their touch turns things to dust, a storm follows in their footsteps, nightmares fill every house in which they sleep, etc.
  *Marks:* O O O O O
- The spirit prevents the victim from ever feeling a certain kind of satisfaction -- e.g. fullness of belly, slake of thirst, rest, love, lust, etc.
  *Marks:* O O O O O
- Draw upon your knowledge of spirits to make your own.

## The Order's Discipline

**If it's your first time consulting these instructions, or you're consulting them at the beginning of a session, or in between sessions:** Check the disciplinary measures below to see if the priest has already incurred the Order's discipline. If any measures are marked "reported" with no further marks, you now have an additional duty to bring these measures to bear as soon as possible, within reason, even without the priest's asking.

Otherwise, **if the priest has hazarded a transgression and risks the discipline of their Order,** use the rules below to determine if they bring it down.

**Consideration:** How bad is the violation? If it seems especially egregious, pick a disciplinary action that seems fitting. Otherwise, pick the first one that isn't already marked "reported".

**Consideration:** Does the Order know of the priest's transgression, or are they certain or likely to find out?

A violation cannot be disciplined without first being reported to the Order. Consider who, if anyone, was affected by or witnessed the violation. Besides good conscience, why might they report, or not? When will they next have the opportunity to contact another member of the Order?

**If a report is likely and forthcoming,** mark as Reported the first disciplinary action not already so marked, and interpret it as the basis for your answer.

**If a report is likely but not forthcoming,** decide whether to mark an entry. You may also forestall deciding.

**Either way,** take don't tell the priest whether they are reported unless it should be obvious. You now have a duty to

**Consideration:** Disciplinary action is not usually immediate. It requires the time for a report to be made and move through the proper channels. You now have an additional duty to decide when and where the priest encounters the action itself, once it's been reported.  Use the checkboxes under the action to keep track of its progress.
