# Atlas of the Weave
*Version 0.1*

## The Woven World

The world is old. It has seen many epochs and ages. With time it has grown strange and dreamlike. For some time, a great Empire ruled over all. Now only ruins remain.

It’s not Earth, probably, although it has a single yellow sun and a single white moon and three stars in a row in the winter sky that everyone recognizes. It has summers and winters, forests and deserts, great various continents and unmeasured salt seas. It has horses, dogs, cats, birds, cattle, lions, hyenas, camels, llamas, marsupials, mustelidae, primates, pachyderms.

If you went there you could breathe the air but the language would be unknown to you and the food and fashions unfamiliar.

### Human Nature

Human beings love to have full bellies, warm rugs, sweet sad music, and their loved ones nearby.

They hate violence, hunger, fear, cold, injustice, and their friends who have wronged them.

They work stone, clay, wood, metal, cloth, fur, glass, horn, sinew, bark, leaves, leather, and reeds. They cook their food, brew their drink, bury their pickles, eat fruit in season, eat fish when it runs, and eat salt when they have it. They hold their nose when the healer makes them swallow balms and pungencies.

### The Weave and the Order

The roads are not just the ancient concrete causeways of the fallen Empire, though these number among them. They do not end with the dirt trails connecting villages, nor even the faint paths demarcated by old stones that lead only to ruins. They include even narrow divots through the grasses between two lovers' houses, if these see enough use. The overgrown track to an old shrine, remembered only now by rabbits and a handful of pilgrims -- this too is part of the roads.

The roads bind the world in a tapestry, woven together by countless and variegated threads. They draw it together, holding the cities, homes, fields, and harbours in their place, maintaining their connection, and preserving the distance between the wild and dangerous spirits and the decent affairs of humanfolk.

This arrangement was not easily won. A maddening webwork of compacts, wards, protections and bindings keeps the spirits placid. An equally complex matrix of mortal duties, accords, and tireless labour, ensures that the roads do not decay and disappear.

Two webs: The roads and its laws. Each is tangled, messy, and crucial. All together they are called the Weave. The Order of the Roads, through its Priests, sees to its care.

### The Priest's Vows

_In the order of their precedence:_

1. Tend to the Weave.
2. Accept such petitions and supplications as are possible.
3. Conduct your charge safely to their destination.
4. Do no harm, except as is necessary for the protection of your life and your charge.

### Petitions and Charges

The roads remain perilous. Malevolent spirits and humanfolk inhabit the places where the Weave is weakest, and the great forces of nature are beyond any construction or compact. Beyond their ordinary duties tending the Weave, priests of the road are sworn to assist travelers by road (and sometimes even beyond it) in reaching their destination.

A _petition_ is a formal agreement between a road priest and a traveler -- the priest's _charge_ -- to accompany the charge to their destination. The priest's duties to their charge include seeing to their safety and basic welfare for the duration of the voyage, determining the path to the destination, and, if necessary, protecting the charge's life from peril, even at the priest's own risk.

A petition is a sacred duty; It is also a business exchange. To enter a petition, a charge must provide the priest with half of the requisite tithe, and guarantee the other half pending successful completion of the voyage.

The priest may refuse any petition that they deem impossible, or that would guarantee the death of the priest or the charge. The priest may also refuse accepting a second petition would cause them to violate the first. Beyond this, the petition is a weighty obligation, and noncompliant priests are liable to face swift excommunication.

In this game, you will play through a series of voyages, many of which will be in the company of a charge. Don't worry about the nuances of tithing; Believe petitioners who claim they can pay, unless they give you good reason to doubt them.

Remember that your duties and authority are heavily circumscribed by your vows. Your charge may be righteous, or evil, or merely tithing. Such matters are outside the Weave. Their journey is theirs.

#### Supplications

Sometimes a person must travel but cannot petition, and so throws themself at the mercy of the Order. The Order is not insensate to such plight.

A _supplication_ is a special kind of petition that suspends the ordinary rules of petitioning. It requires, first, _circumstance._ The supplicant must be in mortal danger, or have a critical duty (be it temporal or spiritual) that can only be met with the help of the priest. Second, it requires _urgency_: The circumstance cannot wait for the help of another, or the regular arrangement of the tithe.

A tithe is not required for a supplication, although it is still expected when the supplicant has the means to pay it.

If a priest deems a supplication valid, none of the other rules of petitioning apply. It is then the priest's most sacred duty to accept the supplication. They may still refuse a supplication if they deem the voyage impossible, but doing so frivolously will meet with severe discipline by the Order. A dutiful priest will at least try to honour a supplication made in good faith.

### The Limits of the Order

The Weave spreads wide across the world, but the Order exists primarily in the minds, bodies, and acts of its adherents. No broken vow can be disciplined if it is not first reported. A priest does well to remember this, too.

## Charges

Every charge journeys for reason .

## Spirits

Spirits are of the world. They are in the winds, the mountains, the forests and the trees. They are everywhere, though they are fewer and weaker where humans live within the Weave. They are not the restless souls of the dead, which are called ghosts.

Every spirit is unique. What every spirit wants most is to be entirely itself. Humans make this difficult: they break the stone and make it into houses. They cut the tree and make wood into fire. They clear the forests to plant their fields, and carve roads through both.

Among other things, the Weave represents humanity and spirits' best effort at coexistence. It puts each in its place, and sets the terms for their coexistence.

On rare occasion, a spirit forms from something human-made. Old houses, beloved toys, and well-used scissors, are among the more common examples.

## Monsters

When humans’ needs are met and their hearts full, they are well and wholly within their nature. However, when they are too long deprived of one need or another, their hearts may gnarl into other forms to compensate. Sometimes their bodies follow. Thus are monsters born.

All monsters were once human. Most still are. Remind the priest of this if they forget.

## Language

Members of the Order or the Road speak a language of their own called Weavish. Many outside the Order speak it too, at least little. Furthermore, Priests’ training includes a basic education in many of the languages of the Weave. In general, communicating is not a problem for them.

## The Right of Supplication

To invoke the Right of Supplication, the supplicant must say "I invoke the Right of Supplication!" If they do not, continue playing as normal.

When someone invokes the Right of Supplication, the tables turn. For now, it's your job to ask the questions, and the Priest's job to answer. If you were not already in the midst of Negotiating a Petition, tell them to roll, now. Either way, tell them they can still spend any hits to ask if their gut tells them to trust something the petitioner just said or did.

Tell the Priest, "The Right of Supplication is sacred and it is your sacred duty to uphold it. Do you understand this?"

As long as they remain, whatever their answer, continue. Tell the Priest to ask you why the petitioner needs needs their help. Whether or not they do, tell them the petitioner's answer. Ask the Priest whether they believe this reason to be just.

Next, tell them:

* Where the petitioner wants to go.
* Whether the Priest knows the destination to be on any road in the Weave, or if not, whether the supplicant claims to know the way.

Ask the Priest whether they believe the voyage to be possible. If they say no, tell them to spend a hit and tell you why. If they do not give a reason, tell them you need a reason and it's not your job to come up with them, and ask them again why. When they give you an answer, tell them how they can overcome the problem, to spend another hit, and ask them, again, why. Continue in this manner until the Priest concedes that it is possible or runs out of hits, or the supplicant concedes that it is impossible.

Next, you can ask the priest whether they think the petitioner can afford the tithe. Whatever they say, choose one:

* They vow to pay it in full.
* They pledge to pay it in part, in kind, or later.
* They offer what little they have, namely \[x].
* They swear they cannot pay at all.

Ask the priest if they think that's fair. Ignore their answer.

Tell the priest, "I make this supplication out of need and implore your mercy. I swear to follow your guidance, entrust you with my life, stay with you for the duration of our journey, that I intend no evil, and that I have not lied to you. Please, gentle one, believe in my plight and the necessity of my journey, and be dutybound to take me as your charge." Ask them if they do.

**If at last the Priest refuses, makes to leave, or otherwise moves to terminate the supplication without accepting,** tell them they risk disgracing their Order and continue at the peril of its Discipline, and ask them if they do it anyway.

When the supplication ends, resume playing as usual.

## Spirits

Anything offered in good faith to a spirit is received, whether it be thanks, food, valuables, or the priest's time and energy.

Escalations
- scourged
- marked as an enemy

## The Order's Discipline

**If you're consulting these instructions for the first time, at the beginning of a session, or in between sessions:** Check the disciplinary measures below to see if the priest has already incurred the Order's discipline. If any measures marked "reported" with no further marks, you now have an additional duty to decide when and where the priest encounters the action itself, even if the player doesn't ask.

Otherwise, **if the priest has hazarded a transgression and risks the discipline of their Order,** use the rules below to determine if they bring it down.

**Consideration:** How bad is the violation? If it seems especially egregious, pick a disciplinary action that seems fitting. Otherwise, pick the first one that isn't already marked "reported".

**Consideration:** Does the Order know of the priest's transgression, or are they certain or likely to find out?

A violation cannot be disciplined without first being reported to the Order. Consider who, if anyone, was affected by or witnessed the violation. Besides good conscience, why might they report, or not? When will they next have the opportunity to contact another member of the Order?

**If a report is likely and forthcoming,** mark as Reported the first disciplinary action not already so marked, and interpret it as the basis for your answer.

**If a report is likely but not forthcoming,** decide whether to mark an entry. You may also forestall deciding.

**Either way,** take don't tell the priest whether they are reported unless it should be obvious. You now have a duty to

**Consideration:** Disciplinary action is not usually immediate. It requires the time for a report to be made and move through the proper channels. You now have an additional duty to decide when and where the priest encounters the action itself, once it's been reported.  Use the checkboxes under the action to keep track of its progress.
