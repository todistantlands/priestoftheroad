# Mapping the Way
*Version 1*

_Mapping the Way_ is a game to create maps and overland journeys for The Priest of the Road. It can be played in the middle of a session of The Priest of the Road when the Priest studies their voyage, but it can also be played on its own, just for fun, or to create overland adventures for any tabletop roleplaying game!

_Mapping the Way_ can be played with any number of players. By default, it assumes one player is playing as the Priest, in the company of 2 others are volunteers.

You can even play alone! If you do, you'll probably want to gather some random generators, books and images you like, and other materials to inspire you with interesting answers to questions.

The goal of this game to work together to create a map showing the way through a fantastical world, from a starting point to a destination. The map you make might represent an actual, physical map created by someone inhabiting that world, or it might just be someone's understanding of how to get from one place to another. Either way, like real maps, it won't tell the whole story, so don't worry about leaving gaps or making it feel complete. Some things can only be found out on the journey itself.

### Answering Questions

Sometimes these rules will ask you a question. If you're studying a voyage in a game of _The Priest of the Road_, the answer might already be obvious to everyone. For instance, the answer to "who is making this map?" is probably the Priest! If you already established in the game that voyage will take hours or days, then there's your answer to "how is the duration of the voyage measured?" If it isn't obvious, the Priest can suggest answers, but should let the volunteers decide.

If you aren't playing, you can imagine this map was made by someone in a fantastical world. Get with the other players to decide who made it.

Or, just pick whatever seems interesting, or at random if nothing does!

### Ending the Game

Anyone can declare the game over at any time. This game has a built-in stopping point, but you might find yourself running short on time, tired of playing it, or simply satisfied with the map as it is. The point is, once someone says it's over, it's over.

If you are in the middle of playing _The Priest of the Road_, this is the priest's map, and that's as good as it's going to get, for now.

If someone ends the game before you're ready and you're disappointed because you had a cool idea you wanted to put on the map, just write it down or tell the other players about that idea! If you're using the map for a game of _The Priest of the Road_. Your idea might end up on it anyway.

### Setup

Get a sheet of paper to represent your map and at least one pencil, and eraser, or some online tool what will let you draw and write together. You'll also need six-sided dice -- the more, the better. If you don't have a lot of six-sided dice, you'll want to grab some tokens of two different colours, or another piece of paper (or a section of your map) to keep count of hits and misses.

Start by answering the following questions:

**Where does this journey begin?** Draw a point on the map, close to a corner or edge. Leave a bit of room around it. Label it with the name of where the journey starts.

**Where is the destination?** Draw a point far away from the starting point, but leave some room around it. Label it with the name of your destination.

**What do we already know about the way?** If you're playing this game as part of a game of _The Priest of the Road_, or you simply have strong ideas about how this path should be, take a moment to talk with the other players about what you already know to be along the way. Take turns adding those items to the map.

### Building the Pool

Now, you'll need to build a pool of dice to roll. Answer the questions below.

If you aren't playing this as part of a game of _The Priest of the Road_, these questions might not be all that interesting. If you want, you can just skip this section and just roll six dice. Count your hits and misses as described under _Rolling and Adjusting._ If you're really in a hurry, pick from this list:

* _For a short game:_ Use one die per player, minimum 3 dice.
* _For an average-length game:_ Use 7 dice.
* _For longer game:_ Use 9 dice.
* _For a luxuriously long game:_ Use 14 dice.

**Who is making this map?** Choose one, or add 3 to the pool:

* _A Priest of the Road:_ Add their tally for Exerting Yourself with the Arts of your Order.
* _A master cartographer, expert guide, or learned sage:_ Add 3.
* _A cartographer, explorer, or one familiar with the voyage:_ Add 2.
* _A lost interloper, or a foreigner going by rumour and speculation:_ Add 1.

**How is the duration of the voyage measured?** Choose one, or add 2:

* _In hours:_ Subtract 1.
* _In about a day:_ Leave the pool as is.
* _In days:_ Add 2.
* _In weeks_: Add 4.
* _In months:_ Add 8.

**What reference materials does the maker have at their disposal?** Choose one, or add 1 to the pool:

* _An excellent library:_ Add 2 to the pool.
* _A few useful tomes and maps:_ Add 1 to the pool.
* _What they've learned or recall:_ Leave the pool as is.
* _Nothing but rumours:_ Subtract 1.

**Who is helping the map maker?** Choose one, or leave the pool as it is.

* _Learned counsel or a highly experienced guide:_ +2
* _Someone familiar with the territory:_ +1
* _No one:_ +0

**Does the maker enjoy a surfeit of time?** Choose one, or leave the pool as it is:

* _The maker works frantically:_ Remove half the dice, rounding down, from the pool.
* _The maker works hastily:_ Remove 1 die from the pool.
* _The maker works at their leisure:_ Add 2 dice to the pool.
* _The maker works at a measured pace:_ Leave the pool as it is.

Whatever else is true, the pool should have at least 3 dice in it, or at least as many dice as there are players -- whichever is higher. If there are too few dice, add as as many as it takes to have enough.

### Rolling and Adjusting

Now that you've built your pool, roll all the dice. Each die is a _hit_ if it shows a 4-6, or a _miss_ if it shows 1-3. Separate the hits from the misses.

Before filling out the map, answer one more question:

**As far as the map maker has heard, the way is...** Choose one:

* _Perilous:_ Reroll all hits.
* _Safe:_ Reroll all misses. If you don't know, don't care, or the way is neither particularly safe nor perilous, leave the dice as they are.

You're going to start spending your hits and misses, so make sure you have a way to keep track of how many you got of each.

### Drawing the Path

Now you need to draw the best-known path between the starting point and destination. You can choose one player to this, or divide the map up among all the players and let each one draw a section.

The main path is, simply, a line between starting point and destination. It should not run perfectly straight -- it should wind and waver.

Factor in what you know about the path. If it's known to be easy going and direct, keep the line fairly straight and direct. If it's known to be torturous, make it wild and tangled. If you don't know, just make it look interesting.

If you already added items to the map based on what you knew, it's up to the drawer to decide how those link up with the path. Maybe they're right along it, maybe it's a slight detour, maybe they're not on the path at all.

### Filling Out the Map

As you fill out the map, you'll take turns spending your hits and misses to ask questions about the map, and make changes to it based on the questions answers. When you ask a question, you ask it to all the other players – even the Priest.

### Taking Turns and Spending Dice

The flow of taking turns and spending dice differs based on how you are playing, and how many players there are. Read all the sections that apply for your game.

#### With a Priest

If you are playing with a Priest, the Priest asks a question, and then the volunteers do.

When the Priest takes their turn, they must spend a hit to ask the volunteers a question. If they are out of hits, they pass their turn back to the volunteers.

When a volunteer takes their turn, they pose their question to the other volunteer. They may suggest an answer if they wish.

#### Without a Priest

When you play without a Priest, take turns spending dice and asking questions, one at a time. An answer only counts once everyone agrees on it.

The type of die spent should inform how the answer affects a potential traveler. A _miss_ begets hardship and sorrow, whereas a _hit_ begets wonder and tantalizing opportunity.

#### With Two Players

With only two players, the other answers, even if they’re the Priest. If playing with a Priest, the volunteer always has the last say over answers.

#### Alone

If you're playing alone, you'll need to answer your own questions. The answer to your questions will depend on whether you spent a hit or a miss to ask them, as if you were playing without a Priest.

Turning to your sources of inspiration can help you come up with answers, but if one springs to mind that you find inspiring, exciting, and entertaining, just use that. If you're up for a challenge, come up with an answer, _then_ draw upon a source of inspiration, then modify your answer to fit the inspiration.

#### Questions

* _(Drawing or redrawing a path -- straight, winding, or torturous; solid, dashed, or dotted -- between two points on the map.)_ Here is a way to get from here to here. What is this way called, what is known of the path?
* _(Draw a point close to or along a path.)_ Here is a place of shelter -- perhaps an inn, a village, a city, or even just a cave. What is it called, and what is one sure to find there?
* _(Draw a point or region anywhere on the map, or indicate an existing item.)_ This place is ruled by a powerful force. Perhaps it a person, an army, a wizard, a spirit, a monster, or something else. What is it called, and what is the nature of its power?

##### For the Priest only...

If you are playing this game as part of _The Priest of the Road_, the Priest may ask the following questions, in addition to those above.

* _(Indicate a point or region.)_ When last I visited here, [x] happened. Can I expect it to happen again?
* _(Indicate a point.)_ My Order maintains a presence here. It could be an outpost, or a temple, or just an old shrine. What form does its presence take, and why?
* _(Indicate a point along a path.)_ Priests of the Road who visit here are expected to perform a certain ritual before moving on. Why is this ritual required?
* _(Indicate a point along the path.)_ My Order is particularly revered or reviled by the people or spirits around here. Which is it -- revered or reviled, by people or by spirits -- and why?

### Spending the Last Die

Once all the dice are spent, the game ends. If you want, take a minute to look over the map together and share your impressions. What sticks out as interesting, and what seems like it might be missing?

If you're planning to use the map in a game of _The Priest of the Road_, resist the urge to keep working on it. This map represents the best understanding of the voyage available to your Priest right now.
