## The Volunteer's Guide

Thanks for volunteering to play The Priest of the Road with me! Here are the rules.

**\1. Your Goal in the Game:**

You’re doing me a favor just by playing, so you don’t have to worry about winning or losing the game. Your goal is just to say things that you, personally, find honestly entertaining.

**\2. Your Main Job:**

Almost your only job is to get with the other volunteer and make up answers to my questions.

I’ll ask things like “I’m set upon by raiders. What are they like?” You and your fellow volunteer can imagine any raiders you want, exactly the raiders you find most fun, and tell me about them together.

If you want to ask me any questions before you answer mine, to make sure you’ve got all the details right or whatever, please do! I’ll be more than happy to answer them.

Sometimes the answer to one of my questions will be obvious, or you’ll already know it from what somebody’s said before. In that case, just give the obvious answer, no need to second guess.

Sometimes one of my questions will be way out, weird, maybe contextless. You can always ask me clarifying questions, but you can also just say whatever pops into your head and let me be the one who has to make sense of it.

Sometimes I’ll show you one of my sheets and have you choose something from a list, too. Always choose whichever option seems best to you at the moment.

I also have a sheet here called “The Woven World,” which includes a bunch of ideas that you can use and build on. If I didn’t already hand it over, remind me.

**\3. You and the Other Volunteer:**

In order for anything to really count, you and the other volunteer have to agree on it. If you don’t agree about something, it’s not true until you do. Talk it over until you’re both satisfied. I’ll wait!

The reason there are two of you, by the way, is that this way you can trade off and build on each others’ ideas. Neither of you has to do all the work.

If you have any trouble coming to agreement and you want to use some kind of system to decide, like R-P-S or flipping a coin or dibs or something, that’s none of my business. Whatever works for you. Just let me know what you’ve decided.

I have a 6-sided die you can borrow if you want to roll it.

**\4. Ending the game:**

Any of us can end the game whenever we want, for any reason or none at all. It doesn’t matter how abrupt it might be.

If, at any point, it seems impossible to entertain yourself, or not worth it, or anything like that, don’t hesitate, just call an end.

**\5. Thank you!**

You’re the best! I’m lucky to have you.
