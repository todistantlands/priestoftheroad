# The Priest

My priest's name is Aaio. He follows the Order of the Road, maintaining the Weave and accompanying voyagers. He is half elf; he has lived a long time and seen much, but still young in body and mind. He is sensitive, agile, but physically weak and a bit impulsive. He travels with a staff, a well-stocked pack, and his ritual implements. He is a bit lost, and uses the road as an excuse not to think too hard.

### Your Vows

_In the order of their precedence:_
1. Tend to the Weave.
2. Accept such petitions and supplications as are possible.
3. Conduct your charge safely to their destination.
4. Do no harm, except as is necessary for the protection of your life and your charge.

### Your Goals
- Follow the road, wherever it leads you.
- Honour your vows.
- Try to do the right thing, whatever that means to you.
