# The Woven World

The world is old. It has seen many epochs and ages. With time it has grown strange and dreamlike. For some time, a great Empire ruled over all. Now only ruins remain.

Itâ€™s not Earth, probably, although it has a single yellow sun and a single white moon and three stars in a row in the winter sky that everyone recognizes. It has summers and winters, forests and deserts, great various continents and unmeasured salt seas. It has horses, dogs, cats, birds, cattle, lions, hyenas, camels, llamas, marsupials, mustelidae, primates, pachyderms.

If you went there you could breathe the air but the language would be unknown to you and the food and fashions unfamiliar.

## Human Nature

Human beings love to have full bellies, warm rugs, sweet sad music, and their loved ones nearby.

They hate violence, hunger, fear, cold, injustice, and their friends who have wronged them.

They work stone, clay, wood, metal, cloth, fur, glass, horn, sinew, bark, leaves, leather, and reeds. They cook their food, brew their drink, bury their pickles, eat fruit in season, eat fish when it runs, and eat salt when they have it. They hold their nose when the healer makes them swallow balms and pungencies.

## The Priest's Vows

_In the order of their precedence:_

1. Tend to the Weave.
2. Accept such petitions and supplications as are possible.
3. Conduct your charge safely to their destination.
4. Do no harm, except as is necessary for the protection of your life and your charge.

## The Weave and the Order
The roads bind the world in a tapestry, woven together by countless and variegated threads. They draw it together, holding the cities, homes, fields, and harbours in their place, maintaining their connection, and preserving the distance between the wild and dangerous spirits and the decent affairs of humanfolk.

This arrangement was not easily won. A maddening webwork of compacts, wards, protections and bindings keeps the spirits placid. An equally complex matrix of mortal duties, accords, and tireless labour, ensures that the roads do not decay and disappear.

Two webs: The roads and its laws. Each is tangled, messy, and crucial. All together they are called the Weave. The Order of the Roads, through its Priests, sees to its care.

## Spirits
Spirits are of the world. They are in the winds, the mountains, the forests and the trees. They are everywhere, though they are fewer and weaker where humans live within the Weave. They are not the restless souls of the dead, which are called ghosts.

Every spirit is unique. What every spirit wants most is to be entirely itself. Humans make this difficult: they break the stone and make it into houses. They cut the tree and make wood into fire. They clear the forests to plant their fields, and carve roads through both.

Among other things, the Weave represents humanity and spirits' best effort at coexistence. It puts each in its place, and sets the terms for their exchanges.

## Petitions and Charges
A _petition_ is a formal agreement between a road priest and a traveler -- the priest's _charge_ -- to accompany the charge to their destination. The priest's duties to their charge include seeing to their safety and basic welfare for the duration of the voyage, determining the path to the destination, and, if necessary, protecting the charge's life from peril, even at the priest's own risk.

A _supplication_ is a special kind of petition that suspends the ordinary rules of petitioning. It requires, first, _circumstance._ The supplicant must be in mortal danger, or have a critical duty (be it temporal or spiritual) that can only be met with the help of the priest. Second, it requires _urgency_: The circumstance cannot wait for the help of another, or the regular arrangement of the tithe.
