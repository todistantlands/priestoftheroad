## Issues
- Lots of sections might be too long --> register of bindings, incantations
- Travel doesn't feel right. It's a series of hurdles along the way to a destination, but there's a tension. Are we getting there or what? How *big* should the distractions be? What is their *purpose*?
- Spirit communion doesn't feel right. It's because spirits aren't well defined. What can the priest do without asking? What is the priest actually doing when they are exerting themself?

## Questions
- Do I need a *connect* exertion?
- Does character generation lean towards certain stat loadouts? Eg. are spry and staunch picks just less interesting? Is that a problem?
