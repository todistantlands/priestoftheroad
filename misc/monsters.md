## Monsters
When humansâ€™ needs are met and their hearts full, they are well and wholly within their nature. However, when they are too long deprived of one need or another, their hearts may gnarl into other forms to compensate. Sometimes their bodies follow. Thus are monsters born.

All monsters were once human. Most still are. Remind the priest of this if they forget.
