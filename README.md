# Hello!
This is the landing page for my game jam game, *The Priest of the Road*, a hack of / add-on to Vincent and Meguey Baker's *Wizard's Grimoire* series of RPGs.

I'm writing this game in Obsidian and documenting it according to the [Method for Design Materialisation (MDM)](https://www.gamesasresearch.com/mdm) developed by [the Games as Research Group](https://www.gamesasresearch.com/) at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada. To learn more about why I'm using MDM, check out [Why MDM?](#Why%20MDM?), below.

## What's this Game?
From [my first journal:](journals/2024-06-17.md)

>The player assumes the role of a Priest of the Road. Their job is to help maintain the elaborate web of agreements among humans and spirits that help keep the roads safe for travelers, known as the Weave, and to help people traveling the roads. They're a sort of animist riff on the D&D cleric with a heavily sociological bent.
>
>The Priest of the Road has a lot of social power, some magical power, and a lot of obligations expressed most concretely in their vows to their Order. The goal of this game is get the priest into sticky situations where the thing they ought to do isn't the necessarily the one they want to do, and play to see how they manage that tension.

>It's also a game about road trips I guess.

## Why MDM?
Look, I sat in on a roundtable on MDM and got excited and that's why I'm doing this. I'm not an expert or a spokesperson. But here's why I'm excited about it:

1. MDM nudges the designer to work intentionally and reflexively. This helps draw their attention to the design process itself, as well as the stakes of the design.
2. MDM creates a record of the ups and downs of the process, which can benefit other designers (like the other participants in this jam!).
3. MDM generates a rich corpus of qualitative data for use by researchers (like many of the other participants in this jam!).

The principles of MDM I'll be observing are:

1. Using this github repo to share my work as it develops.
2. Annotating all my commits -- as a reflexive exercise and to make the record more legible.
3. Journaling intermittently about my process and uploading the entries to this repo. Since this is a short jam, I'll probably only do this a couple times.
